                I was born and raised in the small town of Milan, Ohio surrounded by farmland and buckeye
                fans (myself included). I joined the United States Army shortly after graduating high school
                and spent six years in settings such as Texas, Kuwait, Iraq, and South Korea. While in the Army,
                I had the pleasure of working with and leading many great people while flying&nbsp;
                {this.aircraftLink()}. During my career, my interest in problem solving and learning how things
                worked grew exponentially. I decided to change gears and moved to Fort Collins, Colorado to further
                my education and to pursue this newly developed interest.

                Iâ€™m currently a senior at Colorado State University majoring in computer science with a
                minor in mathematics. My upper-level computer science classes consist of databases,
                distributed systems, machine learning, and networking. I am experienced with Agile and Scrum
                methodologies as a member of a team during software development. I consider myself proficient
                with object-oriented programming languages though, my favorite language is C. I graduate in
                May 2021 and am eager to find a team to work with and see what we can design and develop.

                When Iâ€™m not wrapping my head around the black magic which is computers, you can find me out on the
                trails. I find trail running to be very relaxing and offsets sitting at a computer for most of the day.
                I plan to run an ultramarathon in the near future whenever I actually get around to training for it.
                I also enjoy mountaineering and so far, I've summited 14 of the 58 fourteeners here in Colorado. But, if
                you've made it this far then thanks for reading! Feel free to get in touch if you want to learn more or
                to just say hi.
